# AlgorithmsProject
Our project implements the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) pattern matching algorithm to find occurrences of a pattern within randomly generated texts. We generate random test cases consisting of text and patterns of varying lengths. Using multiprocessing, we then measure the execution time of the KMP algorithm for each test case.
